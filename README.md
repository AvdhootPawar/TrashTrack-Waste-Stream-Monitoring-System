# ‚ôª TrashTrack-Waste-Stream-Monitoring-System

---

TrashTrack-Waste-Stream-Monitoring-System is an intelligent web-based application meticulously designed to empower **municipalities** in tackling urban trash challenges and fostering **sustainability**. Leveraging advanced object detection technology (YOLOv10), this system provides a practical solution for identifying and categorizing various trash items in real-time, aiding in efficient sorting, recycling efforts, and environmental monitoring. A key feature is its ability for **users to upload their own data**, actively contributing to and enhancing the system's capabilities.

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities

This application offers versatile trash detection capabilities across different media types:

### 1. Image Detection

* **Upload & Analyze:** Allows users to upload image files (JPG, PNG, BMP, WEBP) for instant trash detection.
* **Visual Output:** Displays both the original and the processed image with detected trash items highlighted by bounding boxes and labels.

### 2. Video Detection

* **Process Uploaded Videos:** Supports processing of video files (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV) to identify trash over time.
* **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:** Applies the YOLOv10 model to each frame, providing a real-time-like detection experience within the video.
* **Downloadable Output:** Generates and allows downloading of the processed video with detected objects.

### 3. Live Webcam Detection

* **Real-time Analysis:** Connects to the user's webcam for live, continuous trash detection.
* **Dynamic Overlay:** Overlays bounding boxes and labels directly onto the live video feed.
* **Interactive Control:** Features a toggle to easily start and stop the webcam feed.
